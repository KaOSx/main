-    # Comments on numpy build requirement range:
-    #
-    #   1. >=2.0.x is the numpy requirement for wheel builds for distribution
-    #      on PyPI - building against 2.x yields wheels that are also
-    #      ABI-compatible with numpy 1.x at runtime.
-    #   2. Note that building against numpy 1.x works fine too - users and
-    #      redistributors can do this by installing the numpy version they like
-    #      and disabling build isolation.
-    #   3. The <2.3 upper bound is for matching the numpy deprecation policy,
-    #      it should not be loosened.
